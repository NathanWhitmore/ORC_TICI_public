# ORC_TICI
Open source R code for visualising Taxon-Independent Community Index (TICI) data produced by Wilderlab..

The development of this code was fully funded by Otago Regional Council to facilitate use of eDNA for monitoring stream health.

API keys from Wilderlab need to be stored in an excel file labelled "API keys.xlsx" under the following column headers: key, secret, xapikey. Note that no such file is currently associated with the downloadable files on this site (for security reasons).
